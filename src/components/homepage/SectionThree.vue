        <p>
          I work as a Freelancer and Iâ€™m crafting a Website for The Team, a
          young startup which provides sport trading online courses. The main
          goal is to build a platform easy to use that helps the users to buy
          the courses and, in the future, use the platform to see the courses.

          Before now, I was a Jr Full Stack Developer at Yeldo, an online
          platform that grants digital access to real estate investments for
          professional investors, where I worked mainly on the user dashboard
          and the admin backoffice.

          Prior to Yeldo, I was a React Developer in Runtheons, building the new
          Institutional website.
